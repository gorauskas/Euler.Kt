        Project Euler Problem 32:

            We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all
            the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234,
            is 1 through 5 pandigital.

            The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing
            multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

            Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
            can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

            HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to
            only include it once in your sum.
