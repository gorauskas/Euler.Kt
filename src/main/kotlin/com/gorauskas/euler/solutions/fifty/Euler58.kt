        Project Euler Problem 58

            Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square
            spiral with side length 7 is formed.

            It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right
            diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers
            lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

            If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square
            spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued,
            what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes
            along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

        The side length of the square spiral is ${timer { solve() }}.
